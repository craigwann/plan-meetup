# Optional Meetup Review
This section you had the opportunity to attend a tech event instead of completing the week 4 independent project. Tech events include networking nights, mentoring groups, lectures, discussions, etc. The priority is to get out into the tech community to connect with people who have similar interests and to learn new skills. If you're unsure what your specific interests are, attending a tech event is a great way to figure out what you would like to pursue.

If you would like to opt out of the independent project, reflect on your experience at the meetup you chose to attend and write a review about it. Please answer the following questions:

* What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?<br>
`Portland JR DEVELOPER meetup, Wednesday, September 19, 2018
5:30 PM to 7:00 PM`

* Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?<br>
`Planet Argon with speaker: Michelle Levine - Front End Web Developer`
* What was the format of the event?
* What was the topic or main focus of the event?
* What made you want to attend this particular event?
* What was the highlight of the event?
* What did you learn from this experience?
* If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)
* Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?
* Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.
