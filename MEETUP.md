# Optional Meetup Review
This section you had the opportunity to attend a tech event instead of completing the week 4 independent project. Tech events include networking nights, mentoring groups, lectures, discussions, etc. The priority is to get out into the tech community to connect with people who have similar interests and to learn new skills. If you're unsure what your specific interests are, attending a tech event is a great way to figure out what you would like to pursue.

If you would like to opt out of the independent project, reflect on your experience at the meetup you chose to attend and write a review about it. Please answer the following questions:

* What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?<br>
`Portland JR DEVELOPER meetup, Wednesday, September 19, 2018
5:30 PM to 7:00 PM`

* Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?<br>
`Planet Argon with speaker: Michelle Levine - Front End Web Developer`
* What was the format of the event?<br>
`Casual get together with pizza and single speaker`
* What was the topic or main focus of the event?<br>
`Building a community and finding your place in existing communities.`
* What made you want to attend this particular event?<br>
`Jr Developer`
* What was the highlight of the event?<br>
`I thought Michelle/Jordan was a great speaker for someone who considered herself to be initially anti-social and not liking people in her youth. Most of the talk was about her path and how she got where she is currently.`
* What did you learn from this experience?<br>
`Get involved with the tech communities. By being involved you end up making the connections needed to excel.`
* If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be? (Many events send out surveys and ask for feedback. Giving constructive feedback is a great way to contribute to the tech community.)<br>
`I'd like to see more speakers from other various coding avenues. It was interesting that she has made a career being a CSS coder but I'd like to see other languages and industries.`
* Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?<br>
`Absolutely, we are, by definition aspiring Jr. Dev's.  Seems like a great place to start the career-long aspect of networking.`
* Is there anything else that stood out about the event? Please feel free to add additional notes.<br>
`I really enjoyed talking/networking with the other participants. Many of them were from competing code school bootcamps.`
